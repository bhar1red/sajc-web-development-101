### Notes 

#### Discussed topics:
Introduction to HTML, HTML Page structure, HTML elements, HTML attributes, Github Pages 

#### Goal & Assignment: 

Have students to create a bare-bones website and host it on github pages. 


#### Notes: 

##### Introduction to HTML page structure, elements and attributes: 

Any file, with .html extension is considered a webpage by browser. So first step in creating our website, is to create ``` index.html ``` 

To start, 
- Create a folder in your computer, we shall use this folder to save all our assignments and futher code. For example, let's call it 'code' or 'examples' or anything you wish. . 
- Open VSCode, click on open folder.

##### Introduction to VSCode: 

Everyone need right tools to make their life better. Choosing a right text-editor, IDE is essential for any developer. 

As the website code grows, it will be tough to manage everything in notepad or system's default text editors. Hence we need to use text-editors that are developer focused.

A few examples for developer focused IDE's are Atom, Sublime Text, VSCode, Vim, Eclipse, Netbeans, ... Each have their own benefits and disadvantages and suitable for specific purposes. 

For this class, we are going to use VSCode. However, it would be helpful in later stages, for you to experiement with other text editors and IDE's and find the one that best suits you and your needs. 

To install VScode, go to : [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Download file.

##### Introduction to Git: 

Version control is the practice of tracing and managing changes to the code. 

Imagine multiple developers, from different locations had to work on same project. It is almost impossible to manage a complex project in such scenario, without Version Control Systems (VCS). VCS provide many benefits, such as concurrent development, tracking changes, collaboration, automation, ...  

Git is the leading version control system. Though not required to develop a website, it is a good practice to use it. Infact, in my experience, if there is one skill that is extremely important for any kind of programmer, it is effectively using git. 

We shall dig deeper into git in next classes,but if you want to have a quick glance, look at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://git-scm.com/) .
