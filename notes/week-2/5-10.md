### College: Sri Amogha Junior College  (SAJC), Hyderabad
### Trainer: Bargav Kondapu
### Date: May 10, 2021

### Notes 

#### Discussed topics:
Introduction to HTML, HTML Page structure, HTML elements, HTML attributes, Github Pages 

#### Goal & Assignment: 

Have students to create a bare-bones website and host it on github pages. 


#### Notes: 

##### Introduction to HTML page structure, elements and attributes: 

HTML follows a tag like structure. Every tag indicates an HTML element. 
For example: \<p\> indicates paragraph, \<h1\> indicates h1 tag. 

A simple HTML file would look like this. 

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> Simple HTML page </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> This is body </p>
  </body>
</html>

```

\<html\> tag indicates that everything with it is an html text. 

\<head\> contains information about website, but not necessarily visible. Think of it like a brain for the body. Additional scripts, metadata are defined here. 

\<body\> body tag is where all content is loaded. It is what displayed in the broswer. 

###### HTML Elements 

HTML element is everything from start tag to end tag. 

example: ``` <p> This is a Paragraph element </p> ```, ``` <h1> This is a heading element </h1> ```

Please note, every opening tag must be closed. If not, webpage looks wierd. Infact, that is why it is heavily recommended to use an IDE like VSCode, which detecting if we are missing any closing tags. 

###### HTML Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. 

Examples: 

``` <a href="https://www.google.com"> google </a> ```  \<a\> is a html element, which indicated a hyper link and href is the attribute which defines link. 

``` <img src="src/images.jpg"> ``` \<img\> is a html element to indicate an image, src is attribute which points what image to load. 


A typical webpage is combination of different elements and their attributes.

Please visit [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) to understand HTML structure better. It is well organized and considered a standard for learning webdevelopment. 



##### Project Setup: 

Any file, with .html extension is considered a webpage by browser. So first step in creating our website, is to create ``` index.html ``` 

To start, 
- Create a folder in your computer, we shall use this folder to save all our assignments and futher code. For example, let's call it 'code' or 'examples' or anything you wish. . 
- Open VSCode, click on open folder. 
![VS Code Open Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhar1red/sajc-web-development-101/master/notes/week-2/images/vs-code-open-folder.png)
- Select 'code' or 'example' folder, created in first step. 
- In left bar, you should see the folder being loaded. First icon is to create a new file. Second icon is to create new Folder. 

![VS Code Left Bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhar1red/sajc-web-development-101/master/notes/week-2/images/vs-code-left-menu.png)

- From now on, we shall try to maintain our code and folder structure through VSCode. 
- We shall create a new folder, for each exercise. For this one, let's create a folder called week2. 
- In week2, click on create new file, and type ``` index.html ``` as it's name. Notice, it's a lower case i, not capital I in file name. 
If everything is good, you should see folder structure simillar to this.

- Since our website have 3 pages, let's create other two pages as well. Create ``` contact.html ```, ``` about.html ``` files.

##### Homepage/ index.html: 

Let's start building our homepage. ``` index.html ``` is usually considered homepage for websites.  We shall follow structure and components we identified in previous class [Week1 5-5](https://bargavkondapu.com/sajc-web-development-101/notes/week-1/5-5#different-components-of-a-website)

We divide our web page into 3 sections. Header, Main Content, Footer. 

- Header consists of elements like logo, navbar, search, .
- Main Content consists of actual contents of webpage. 
- Footer consits of elements like contact info, copyright information. 

Let's start building out index.html 

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Home Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="header">

        </div>
        <div class="main-content">

        </div>
        <div class="footer">

        </div>
    </body>
</html>

```

Please note, in HTML5, we use semantics instead of div attributes. So a typical html file would look like this. 

```html 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Home Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>

        </header>
        <main>

        </main>
        <footer>

        </footer>
    </body>
</html>

```

But for sake of present exercise, we shall use first one. 

Now, let's start creating header. Header consists of Logo and Menu bar, which can be created as follows. 

```html 

        <div class="header">
            <img src="logo.jpg" height="50px" width="50px">
            
            <div class="menu">
                <a href="index.html"> Home </a> |
                <a href="about.html"> About </a> |
                <a href="contact.html"> Contact </a> |
            </div>
        </div>

```
logo.jpg is the logo I want to be displayed. Place it in directory alongside html files. 

About, Contact would load about and contact pages accordingly. 

For Body, let's place content in <p> tag. 
  
  ```html
  
          <div class="main-content">
            <p> THis is main content. It says something about the website. </p>
        </div>
        
  ```
  
This is what our final index.html file would look like. 

```html 

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Sri Amogha WD101 </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="header">
            <img src="logo.jpg" height="50px" width="50px">
            
            <div class="menu">
                <a href="index.html"> Home </a> |
                <a href="about.html"> About </a> |
                <a href="contact.html"> Contact </a> |
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p> THis is main content. It says something about the website. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="footer">

        </div>
    </body>
</html>

```

##### contact.html and about.html

Create contact.html and about.html pages, same as index.html. Replace main-content with  ``` <p> This is contact page </p> ``` , ``` <p> this is about page </p> ```

If we open index.html in webbrowser, we should see something like this. You shall navigate among different pages, using menu bar.

##### Github Pages: 

Through out the course, we use github to host our code and github pages to host our website. Github is a code hosting platform. Alternatives to github, people might use are gitlab, bitbucket,. 

Steps: 
- Create an account in github.
