#### Discussed topics:
Different components on a website, how is a website structured, Different types of computer languages, Introduction to HTML/CSS. 

#### Goal & Assignment: 

To understand how to think about or designing a website, this has to be done before we start developing. 

Students to browse different websites, and draw a rough sketch on how they want their own website to look like. 
We shall discuss them in next class and expand up on it. We shall use this as basis, while actually building your website. 

#### Notes: 

##### Different Components of a website: 
We opened a few websites - Instagram, bargavkondapu.com, cancer.gov, and identified various elements that are present in them.

Buttons, Links, Logo, Images, Videos, Text, Layout, Search bar, are some of the answers we received. It's good to understand that a website is a mixture of different elements. 

Students must understand some of the commonly used elements. It is also a good idea to browse different websites and check if there are certain elements or variations of certain elements you would like to have in your website.

In webdevelopment, there is no wrong in getting inspired from other sites. Just don't make the exact replica. 

Also, students identified that a web page is usually divided into three parts. Header, Body, Footer. 

Header contains logo, site title, navigation menu  
Body contains content, images, videos, cards  
Footer contains contact information, copyright text, link to other pages. 

##### Computer Languages: 
We discussed how a computer understands instructions and different types/levels of programming languages. 
![Types of Programming Languages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhar1red/sajc-web-development-101/master/notes/week-1/images/types-of-languages.png)

Computer Hardware only understands Binary Language. which is 1 and 0. 1 represents Yes and 0 represents No.

Users usually code in high level languages, like PHP, Java, Python. Which is then converted to a low level assembly language by compiler. Assembly language is then tansformed into binary to give instructions to computer. 

HTML is a high level language, in terms of ease of understanding.  However, HTML is not a programming language, rather a Markup language. Javascript on the other hand, which is also used when rendering websites is a high level programming language. 

##### HTML/CSS/JS: 

__HTML__: Hyper Text Markup Language. This is used to render elements in website. 
__CSS__: Cascading Style Sheets. Used to style the html elements. 
__JS__: Javascript. Programming language used to perform certain tasks within the browser. 

##### First Website: 
Students created their first website. 
- Step 1: Open notepad
- Step 2: Type in the following code. 
```
<html>
<head>
<title> First Website </title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
- Save as ``first-website.html`` 
- Open the file using a webbrowser. (Right click on file, openwith -> chrome) or (Drag file onto browser) 

Congratulations! You just created your first website. Kudos!!!!
