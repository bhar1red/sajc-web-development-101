#### Goal & Assignment: 

Have an open discussion about all topics we discussed for the week! 
Students to install and start using VSCode. Understand concepts of git. 


#### Notes: 

##### Open discussion: 
Had a quick recap of previous two classes. Went through students assignments, on how they wanted their website to look like. Provided feedback and enhancements. 


##### Introduction to VSCode: 

Everyone need right tools to make their life better. Choosing a right text-editor, IDE is essential for any developer. 

As the website code grows, it will be tough to manage everything in notepad or system's default text editors. Hence we need to use text-editors that are developer focused.

A few examples for developer focused IDE's are Atom, Sublime Text, VSCode, Vim, Eclipse, Netbeans, ... Each have their own benefits and disadvantages and suitable for specific purposes. 

For this class, we are going to use VSCode. However, it would be helpful in later stages, for you to experiement with other text editors and IDE's and find the one that best suits you and your needs. 

To install VScode, go to : https://code.visualstudio.com/, Download file.

##### Introduction to Git: 

Version control is the practice of tracing and managing changes to the code. 

Imagine multiple developers, from different locations had to work on same project. It is almost impossible to manage a complex project in such scenario, without Version Control Systems (VCS). VCS provide many benefits, such as concurrent development, tracking changes, collaboration, automation, ...  

Git is the leading version control system. Though not required to develop a website, it is a good practice to use it. Infact, in my experience, if there is one skill that is extremely important for any kind of programmer, it is effectively using git. 

We shall dig deeper into git in next classes,but if you want to have a quick glance, look at https://git-scm.com/ .
